Description: A rewrite the Heroes of Might and Magic 3 engine
 The purpose of VCMI project is to rewrite entire HOMM 3: WoG engine from
 scratch, giving it new and extended possibilities. It will help to support
 mods and new towns already made by fans but abandoned because of game code
 limitations.
 .
 In its current state it already supports maps of any sizes, higher
 resolutions and extended engine limits.
